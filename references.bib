	abstract = {Proper organization, planning and design of production, storage locations, transportation and scheduling are vital to retain the competitive edge of companies in the global economy.Typical additional problems in the chemical industry suitable for optimization are process design, process synthesis and multi-component blended-flow problems leading to nonlinear or even mixed integer nonlinear models. Mixed integer optimization (MIP) determines optimal solutions of such complex problems; the development of new algorithms, software and hardware allow the solution of larger problems in acceptable times. This tutorial paper addresses two groups. The focus towards the first group (managers and senior executives) and readers who are not very familiar with mathematical programming is to create some awareness regarding the potential benefits of MIP, to transmit a sense of what kind of problems can be tackled, and to increase the acceptance of MIP. The second group (a more technical audience with some background in mathematical optimization), might rather appreciate the state-of-the-art view on good-modelling practice, algorithms and an outlook into global optimization. Some real-world MIP problems solved by BASF's mathematical consultants are briefly described, among them discrete blending and multi-stage production planning and distribution with several sites, products and periods. Finally, there is a focus on future perspectives and sources of MIP support are indicated from academia, software providers and consulting firms.},

	abstract = {Quantum optimization solvers typically rely on one-variable-to-one-qubit mapping. However, the low qubit count on current quantum computers is a major obstacle in competing against classical methods. Here, we develop a qubit-efficient algorithm that overcomes this limitation by mapping a candidate bit string solution to an entangled wave function of fewer qubits. We propose a variational quantum circuit generalizing the quantum approximate optimization ansatz (QAOA). Extremizing the ansatz for Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass problems, we show valuable properties such as the concentration of ansatz parameters and derive performance guarantees. This approach could benefit near-term intermediate-scale and future fault-tolerant small-scale quantum devices.},

	abstract = {We propose and analyze a set of variational quantum algorithms for solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems where a problem consisting of nc classical variables can be implemented on O(log⁡nc) number of qubits. The underlying encoding scheme allows for a systematic increase in correlations among the classical variables captured by a variational quantum state by progressively increasing the number of qubits involved. We first examine the simplest limit where all correlations are neglected, i.e. when the quantum state can only describe statistically independent classical variables. We apply this minimal encoding to find approximate solutions of a general problem instance comprised of 64 classical variables using 7 qubits. Next, we show how two-body correlations between the classical variables can be incorporated in the variational quantum state and how it can improve the quality of the approximate solutions. We give an example by solving a 42-variable Max-Cut problem using only 8 qubits where we exploit the specific topology of the problem. We analyze whether these cases can be optimized efficiently given the limited resources available in state-of-the-art quantum platforms. Lastly, we present the general framework for extending the expressibility of the probability distribution to any multi-body correlations.},

	abstract = {Mission planning often involves optimising the use of ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) assets in order to achieve a set of mission objectives within allowed parameters subject to constraints. The missions of interest here, involve routing multiple UAVs visiting multiple targets, utilising sensors to capture data relating to each target. Finding such solutions is often an NP-Hard problem and cannot be solved efficiently on classical computers. Furthermore, during the mission new constraints and objectives may arise, requiring a new solution to be computed within a short time period. To achieve this we investigate near term quantum algorithms that have the potential to offer speed-ups against current classical methods. We demonstrate how a large family of these problems can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and then converted to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO). The formulation provided is versatile and can be adapted for many different constraints with clear qubit scaling provided. We discuss the results of solving the QUBO formulation using commercial quantum annealers and compare the solutions to current edge classical solvers. We also analyse the results from solving the QUBO using Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithms (QAOA) and discuss their results. Finally, we also provide efficient methods to encode to the problem into the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) formalism, where we have tailored the ansatz to the problem making efficient use of the qubits available.},

	abstract = {Parameterized quantum circuits play an essential role in the performance of many variational hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is to choose an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and number of parameters. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, parameterized circuits, we propose several descriptors, including measures of expressibility and entangling capability, that can be statistically estimated from classical simulations of parameterized quantum circuits. We compute these descriptors for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From our simulations, we identify circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors. In particular, we quantify the substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement compared to that of those on a line. Furthermore, we quantify the improvement in expressibility and entangling capability achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, we investigate how expressibility "saturates" with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated-value appear to be distinguishing features of a parameterized quantum circuit template. While the correlation between each descriptor and performance of an algorithm remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for both algorithm development and design of experiments for general variational HQC algorithms.},

	abstract = {Hybrid quantum/classical variational algorithms can be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers and can be used to find solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. Approaches discussed in the literature minimize the expectation of the problem Hamiltonian for a parameterized trial quantum state. The expectation is estimated as the sample mean of a set of measurement outcomes, while the parameters of the trial state are optimized classically. This procedure is fully justified for quantum mechanical observables such as molecular energies. In the case of classical optimization problems, which yield diagonal Hamiltonians, we argue that aggregating the samples in a different way than the expected value is more natural. In this paper we propose the Conditional Value-at-Risk as an aggregation function. We empirically show -- using classical simulation as well as quantum hardware -- that this leads to faster convergence to better solutions for all combinatorial optimization problems tested in our study. We also provide analytical results to explain the observed difference in performance between different variational algorithms.},
