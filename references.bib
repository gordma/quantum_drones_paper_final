	abstract = {The rising popularity of drones significantly impacts package delivery services, offering both unique opportunities and challenges. This survey explores the diverse applications of drones for last-mile deliveries, highlighting their capacity to access remote areas and create new business prospects. Use cases, ranging from critical medical deliveries to addressing COVID-19 pandemic needs, underscore the transformative potential of drone technology. While recognizing drones’ eco-friendly attributes in eliminating harmful gas emissions, the survey addresses battery constraints, necessitating an investigation into physical energy models to extend flight autonomy. This becomes crucial for operational capabilities, especially in adverse weather conditions. A reliable communication infrastructure is crucial for the success of drone operations in package delivery, especially during unexpected events, as seamless connectivity plays a key role in facilitating efficient control and monitoring between ground stations and drones. This enables dynamic rerouting, enhancing overall delivery reliability. The survey explores innovative approaches, including collaborations with other vehicles like trucks, trains, and buses, optimizing the last-mile delivery process. Despite the transformative potential, concerns about privacy, security, safety, and risk management in drone delivery are acknowledged. The work also emphasizes responsible and ethical implementation, considering diverse concerns associated with widespread adoption.          In contrast to existing survey articles focused on specific technical aspects, this comprehensive survey broadens its scope. It covers ethical issues, sustainability aspects, healthcare systems, physics models, innovative approaches, reliable communications, security and safety concerns, and real test-beds in drone-based delivery systems. The survey not only identifies potential applications and tackles technical challenges but also integrates broader considerations. In addition, this work extensively explores the motivations, lessons learned, and future directions in the realm of drone delivery. Analyzing existing literature, it provides valuable insights for researchers, industry professionals, policymakers, and stakeholders keen on understanding the dynamic evolution of drone technology in the package delivery domain.},

We show that our approach allows for a significant reduction in the number of calls to the quantum circuit, which is typically the most expensive part of the QAOA. We demonstrate that our method works well also in the regime of slow circuit repetition rates, and that few measurements of the quantum ansatz would already suffice to achieve a good estimate of the energy. In addition, we study the performance of our method in the presence of noise at gate level, and we find that for low circuit depths it is robust against noise. Our results suggest that the method proposed here is a promising framework to leverage the hybrid nature of QAOA on the noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.},

We focus on a quantum-inspired version of GEO relying on tensor-network Born machines, and referred to hereafter as TN-GEO. To illustrate our results, we run these benchmarks in the context of the canonical cardinality-constrained portfolio optimization problem by constructing instances from the S\&P 500 and several other financial stock indexes, and demonstrate how the generalization capabilities of these quantum-inspired generative models can provide real value in the context of an industrial application. We also comprehensively compare state-of-the-art algorithms and show that TN-GEO is among the best; a remarkable outcome given the solvers used in the comparison have been fine-tuned for decades in this real-world industrial application.

	abstract = {Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) is a hybrid algorithm for noisy quantum devices. However, statistical fluctuations and physical noise degrade the solution quality, so it is difficult to maintain applicability for large-scale problems. In contrast, Sampling-based Quantum Algorithms have recently been successfully applied to large-scale quantum chemistry problems. The quantum device is used only for sampling, and the ground state and its energy are estimated on the classical device. In this study, we propose the Sampling-based Quantum Optimization Algorithm (SQOA). Two challenges exist in constructing a Sampling-based Quantum Algorithm for combinatorial optimization. The first challenge is that we need to encode the optimization problem in a non-diagonal Hamiltonian, even though many VQAs encode it into the Ising Hamiltonian, which is diagonal. The second challenge is that we need a method to prepare the input state to be sampled efficiently. We employ the Quantum Relaxation (QR) method for the first challenge, which encodes multiple classical variables in one qubit. It reduces required qubits compared to the Ising Hamiltonian approach. Moreover, we investigate the parameter transferability in the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz for QR Hamiltonians for the second challenge. We show that restricting parameters to a linear form exhibits moderate transferability for 3-regular MaxCut problems, similar to transferability observed in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. This property allows us to efficiently prepare the input state for a large instance using the parameters from a small instance. We leveraged transferability to create input states and applied SQOA with QR to the MaxCut instances. Transferring parameters from a 20-node problem demonstrates that SQOA with QR provides high-quality solutions for 40-node problems without variational parameter optimization.},

In this article, we present a framework for constructing mixing operators that restrict the evolution to a subspace of the full Hilbert space given by these constraints; We generalize the "XY"-mixer designed to preserve the subspace of "one-hot" states to the general case of subspaces given by a number of computational basis states. We expose the underlying mathematical structure which reveals more of how mixers work and how one can minimize their cost in terms of number of CX gates, particularly when Trotterization is taken into account. Our analysis also leads to valid Trotterizations for "XY"-mixer with fewer CX gates than is known to date. In view of practical implementations, we also describe algorithms for efficient decomposition into basis gates. Several examples of more general cases are presented and analyzed.},

	abstract = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is designed to determine optimum and near optimum solutions of quadratic (and higher order) unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO or HUBO) problems, which in turn accurately model unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems. While the solution space of an unconstrained combinatorial optimization problem consists of all possible combinations of the objective function's decision variables, for a constrained combinatorial optimization problem, the solution space consists only of solutions that satisfy the problem constraints. While solving such a QUBO problem optimally results in an optimal solution to the underlying constrained problem, setting the right penalty parameters is crucial. Moreover, finding suitable penalties that ensure near-optimal solutions is also challenging. In this article, we introduce our innovative profit-relaxation framework to solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems. Our effective hybrid approach transforms a selected constrained combinatorial optimization problem into an unconstrained profit problem, such that the solution spaces of the two problems are interrelated with respect to their solution qualities. This allows us to determine optimal and near-optimal solutions for the constrained problem. We use three NP-hard problems -- Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Independent Set, and Maximum Clique -- to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. We conducted a detailed performance evaluation of our profit-relaxation framework on two different platforms: Xanadu PennyLane and Argonne QTensor Quantum Circuit Simulator.},

In this study, we include a detailed review of the limitations encountered when using QUBO for constrained optimization. We show that the proposed method overcomes these limitations by encoding the optimal solution at an energetically elevated level of a simpler problem Hamiltonian, which results in substantially more resource-efficient quantum circuits. We consolidate our strategy with a detailed analysis on how the concepts of Lagrangian duality such as duality gap and complementary slackness relate to the success probability of sampling the optimal solution.

Mixed integer optimization (MIP) determines optimal solutions of such complex problems; the development of new algorithms, software and hardware allow the solution of larger problems in acceptable times. This tutorial paper addresses two groups. The focus towards the first group (managers and senior executives) and readers who are not very familiar with mathematical programming is to create some awareness regarding the potential benefits of MIP, to transmit a sense of what kind of problems can be tackled, and to increase the acceptance of MIP. The second group (a more technical audience with some background in mathematical optimization), might rather appreciate the state-of-the-art view on good-modelling practice, algorithms and an outlook into global optimization. Some real-world MIP problems solved by BASF's mathematical consultants are briefly described, among them discrete blending and multi-stage production planning and distribution with several sites, products and periods. Finally, there is a focus on future perspectives and sources of MIP support are indicated from academia, software providers and consulting firms.},

We first examine the simplest limit where all correlations are neglected, i.e. when the quantum state can only describe statistically independent classical variables. We apply this minimal encoding to find approximate solutions of a general problem instance comprised of 64 classical variables using 7 qubits. Next, we show how two-body correlations between the classical variables can be incorporated in the variational quantum state and how it can improve the quality of the approximate solutions. We give an example by solving a 42-variable Max-Cut problem using only 8 qubits where we exploit the specific topology of the problem.

	abstract = {Mission planning often involves optimising the use of ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) assets in order to achieve a set of mission objectives within allowed parameters subject to constraints. The missions of interest here, involve routing multiple UAVs visiting multiple targets, utilising sensors to capture data relating to each target. Finding such solutions is often an NP-Hard problem and cannot be solved efficiently on classical computers. Furthermore, during the mission new constraints and objectives may arise, requiring a new solution to be computed within a short time period. To achieve this we investigate near term quantum algorithms that have the potential to offer speed-ups against current classical methods. We demonstrate how a large family of these problems can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and then converted to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO). The formulation provided is versatile and can be adapted for many different constraints with clear qubit scaling provided. We discuss the results of solving the QUBO formulation using commercial quantum annealers and compare the solutions to current edge classical solvers. We also analyse the results from solving the QUBO using Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithms (QAOA) and discuss their results. Finally, we also provide efficient methods to encode to the problem into the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) formalism, where we have tailored the ansatz to the problem making efficient use of the qubits available.},

In this work, the use of a previously‐introduced qubit encoding scheme is explored to reduce the number of qubits, to evaluate the effectiveness of Noisy Intermediate‐Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices when applied to industry relevant optimization problems. A quantum variational approach is applied to a testbed of multiple VRPTW instances ranging from 11 to 3964 routes. These intances are formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems based on realistic shipping scenarios. The results are compared with standard binary‐to‐qubit mappings after executing on simulators as well as various quantum hardware platforms, including IBMQ, AWS (Rigetti), and IonQ. These results are benchmarked against the classical solver, Gurobi. The approach can find approximate solutions to the VRPTW comparable to those obtained from quantum algorithms using the full encoding, despite the reduction in qubits required. These results suggest that using the encoding scheme to fit larger problem sizes into fewer qubits is a promising step in using NISQ devices to find approximate solutions for industry‐based optimization problems, although additional resources are still required to eke out the performance from larger problem sizes.},

	abstract = {Parameterized quantum circuits play an essential role in the performance of many variational hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is to choose an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and number of parameters. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, parameterized circuits, we propose several descriptors, including measures of expressibility and entangling capability, that can be statistically estimated from classical simulations of parameterized quantum circuits. We compute these descriptors for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From our simulations, we identify circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors. In particular, we quantify the substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement compared to that of those on a line. Furthermore, we quantify the improvement in expressibility and entangling capability achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, we investigate how expressibility "saturates" with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated-value appear to be distinguishing features of a parameterized quantum circuit template. While the correlation between each descriptor and performance of an algorithm remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for both algorithm development and design of experiments for general variational HQC algorithms.},

In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software. As an optimization software designed with define-by-run principle, Optuna is particularly the first of its kind. We will present the design-techniques that became necessary in the development of the software that meets the above criteria, and demonstrate the power of our new design through experimental results and real world applications.

	abstract = {Hybrid quantum/classical variational algorithms can be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers and can be used to find solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. Approaches discussed in the literature minimize the expectation of the problem Hamiltonian for a parameterized trial quantum state. The expectation is estimated as the sample mean of a set of measurement outcomes, while the parameters of the trial state are optimized classically. This procedure is fully justified for quantum mechanical observables such as molecular energies. In the case of classical optimization problems, which yield diagonal Hamiltonians, we argue that aggregating the samples in a different way than the expected value is more natural. In this paper we propose the Conditional Value-at-Risk as an aggregation function. We empirically show -- using classical simulation as well as quantum hardware -- that this leads to faster convergence to better solutions for all combinatorial optimization problems tested in our study. We also provide analytical results to explain the observed difference in performance between different variational algorithms.},
