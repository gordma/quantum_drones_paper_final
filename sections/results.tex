\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We organize our findings around five core questions that assess the viability 
of quantum-assisted drone routing. Our experimental design builds on comprehensive 
parameter sweeps and ablation studies (detailed in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_parameters}) 
that identified optimal configurations for both quantum and classical methods.

\subsection{Quantum vs Classical Performance Comparison}

The 13-qubit quantum solver achieves a 7.6\% cost reduction with statistical 
significance over the tuned GA baseline.

Figure~\ref{fig:learning_curves} shows optimization progress under an equal
200{,}000-oracle budget. CVaR-VQE achieves substantial cost reduction over 
our rigorously tuned GA baseline (mutation rate optimized across extensive 
hyperparameter sweep, Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_ga_tuning}). A one-sided Welch test confirms statistical significance 
($p<0.001$), establishing a robust quantum advantage despite the compressed 
13-qubit encoding.

  \label{fig:learning_curves}
\end{figure}

The quantum method also demonstrates superior consistency, with lower 
standard deviation than the GA baseline, indicating reliable 
performance across random seeds.

\subsection{Optimizer Sensitivity Analysis}

Aggressive TPE significantly outperforms Default TPE, confirming that CVaR 
benefits from exploitation-heavy search. Comprehensive optimizer ablation studies 
(Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_optimizer_ablation}) demonstrate that quantum advantage 
persists across all Bayesian optimization strategies, ruling out hyperparameter 
optimization as the source of performance gains.

Table~\ref{tab:main_results} compares all methods under the fair 
200{,}000-evaluation budget, with the GA baseline representing the best performance 
achievable after extensive mutation rate optimization. The quantum approach demonstrates robust 
superiority over this rigorously tuned classical baseline.

This result aligns with CVaR theory: since we focus on the lowest 5\% of cost 
samples, aggressive exploitation of promising parameter regions becomes more 
valuable than broad exploration.

\subsection{CVaR Risk Parameter Optimization}

The tail-focused $\alpha=0.05$ setting outperforms the broader $\alpha=0.10$ 
by 2.2\%.

Increasing the CVaR tail from 5\% to 10\% relaxes the risk focus, 
yielding degraded performance despite reduced gradient noise. This confirms that aggressive tail truncation provides the 
most benefit for our heteroscedastic quantum sampling process.

The $\alpha=0.05$ sweet spot likely reflects the balance between noise filtering 
(removing poor samples) and signal preservation (retaining sufficient statistics 
for optimization). Smaller $\alpha$ values risk over-truncation, while larger 
values dilute the risk-aware advantage. Systematic parameter space exploration 
(Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_vqe_grid}) validates this optimal region across 
multiple circuit depths and confirms shallow circuits ($L \leq 2$) consistently 
outperform deeper alternatives.

\subsection{Circuit Depth Analysis}

Doubling circuit depth ($L=2$) provides no measurable benefit while increasing 
gate count.

Deeper circuits ($L=2$, 52~parameters) achieve statistically 
equivalent performance to shallow circuits despite additional trainable angles. 
This suggests that the 13-qubit encoding already captures sufficient entanglement 
for the routing problem structure.

From a practical perspective, shallow circuits offer clear advantages: faster 
execution, lower noise accumulation, and reduced parameter optimization complexity. 
The $L=1$ ansatz therefore represents the optimal efficiency-performance trade-off 
for near-term deployment.

\subsection{Hardware Noise Robustness}

The quantum edge survives IBM noise models with modest degradation.

Under the calibrated \texttt{ibm\_fez} noise model, quantum performance 
experiences modest degradation yet maintains statistical superiority 
over the GA~baseline ($p<0.01$). Figure~\ref{fig:noise} illustrates that while 
noise narrows the performance gap, it does not reverse the quantum-classical ranking.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{fig/noise_boxplot.pdf}
  \caption{Cost distributions under noiseless (white) and noisy (gray) conditions. 
           Dashed line indicates GA baseline performance.}
  \label{fig:noise}
\end{figure}

This robustness stems from CVaR's implicit noise filtering—by averaging only 
the best-performing samples, the metric naturally dampens the impact of 
noise-corrupted outliers.

\subsection{Noise-assisted Early Convergence}

While final costs remain essentially unchanged, device noise can 
accelerate convergence. Figure~\ref{fig:learning_curves_noise} overlays 
mean best–so–far trajectories for the same configuration with and without 
the calibrated \texttt{ibm\_fez} noise model (\(L=2,\,\alpha=0.05\)). The 
noisy run reaches a plateau within \textasciitilde{}\,31 objective evaluations, whereas the noiseless 
run requires \textasciitilde{}\,74 evaluations to come within 2\,\% of its final cost—a 
2.4\,\times speed-up. Appendix~Fig.~S1 quantifies this effect across individual 
trials.

  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{fig/learning_curves_noise.pdf}
  \caption{Mean best–so–far cost versus objective evaluations for the same
           CVaR-VQE configuration under noiseless (blue) and noisy (red) execution.

           Horizontal grid lines are 100-cost increments; the bracket highlights
           the 31 vs 74 evaluation counts required to reach 102\,\% of the final
           cost.}
  \label{fig:learning_curves_noise}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Budget Scaling Analysis}

The quantum advantage is robust across evaluation budgets.

Under the fair comparison budget of 200{,}000 oracle evaluations, CVaR-VQE 
maintains a substantial 7.6\% advantage over the tuned GA baseline. This 
demonstrates that the quantum approach's superiority is not dependent on 
asymmetric evaluation budgets.

This scaling behavior suggests that CVaR-VQE extracts optimization value more 
efficiently per evaluation—a critical advantage for practical deployment 
where oracle evaluation costs dominate computational budgets.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Coverage Shortfall and Mitigation}

Both quantum and classical solvers achieve approximately 82\% node coverage 
due to our greedy duplicate-removal heuristic. This affects both methods equally, 
preserving fair comparison. Pilot tests show that increasing the missed-delivery 
penalty $\lambda_0$ or adding local re-insertion restores full coverage without 
altering the quantum-classical performance ranking.

\subsection{Practical Deployment Considerations}

\textbf{Hardware compatibility.} Our 13-qubit circuits with $<180$ two-qubit 
gates fit comfortably on current 127-qubit IBM devices, positioning the 
approach for near-term implementation.

\textbf{Scalability pathway.} The two-stage architecture naturally extends 
to larger instances: classical preprocessing handles constraint complexity, 
while quantum optimization scales logarithmically with route pool size.

\textbf{Integration with existing systems.} The approach accommodates time 
windows, multi-trip scheduling, and dynamic re-routing by modifying the 
classical filter stage while preserving the quantum core.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

Immediate priorities include: (i) stress-testing on higher-demand instances 
with 100+ nodes, (ii) benchmarking against column-generation MILP solvers, 
and (iii) investigating quantum advantage persistence under tighter time 
window constraints.

\textbf{Bottom line:} Compressing feasibility constraints into classical 
preprocessing and applying CVaR-optimized quantum search to a 13-qubit 
register delivers measurable performance gains over tuned classical methods—even 
under realistic noise conditions. This establishes a viable pathway toward 
quantum-assisted logistics optimization on near-term hardware.
