\subsection{Problem Definition: Subset‑Route Drone VRP}
\label{sec:problem}

Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph with depot node $0$ and
$|V|-1$ customer nodes.  Each edge $(u,v)\in E$ is annotated with

\begin{equation}
    \bigl(t_{uv}, \; b_{uv}, \; c_{uv}\bigr)
    \qquad
    \text{travel time, battery usage, no‑fly flag.}
\end{equation}

A \emph{feasible route} $r\in\mathcal{R}$ is a simple cycle starting and
ending at the depot that satisfies

\begin{equation}
    \textstyle
    \sum_{(u,v)\in r} b_{uv} \le B_{\max},
    \quad
    \sum_{v\in r} d_v \le Q_{\max},
    \quad
    c_{uv}=0 \;\forall(u,v)\in r.
\end{equation}

Given a pre‑computed pool of $N_{routes}$ feasible routes
$\mathcal{R}=\{r_1,\dots,r_{N_{routes}}\}$ and $M=N_{waves}$ discrete launch
waves, the optimisation task is to

\[
\underset{
    \substack{\text{choose exactly }k\\ \text{route–wave pairs}}}
    {\text{minimise}}
\; C(\mathcal{S})
\quad
\text{s.t.}
\;\;
|\mathcal{S}|=k,\;
\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{R}\times\{0,\dots,M-1\},
\]

where $C(\mathcal{S})$ is the mission cost defined in
Eq.\,\eqref{eq:cost}.  The search space size is
$\mathcal{O}\big({\small\binom{N_{routes}}{k} M^{k}}\big)$, motivating a logarithmic
$\lceil\log_2 N_{routes}\rceil+\lceil\log_2 M\rceil$‑qubit encoding for
quantum optimisation.

\subsection{Solution Overview}

To avoid exponential qubit scaling, we split the drone routing problem into two stages. We first filter thousands of constraint-violating routes classically, then apply quantum optimization to select the best feasible subset. This hybrid approach reduces an $\mathcal{O}(10^4 - 10^5)$ problem to just 13 qubits while preserving solution quality.

\subsection{Classical Preprocessing and Feasibility Filtering}

Directly optimizing drone routes considering all constraints remains computationally challenging. Therefore, we introduce a classical preprocessing phase that dramatically reduces subsequent computational complexity. We represent the operational environment as a sparse undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, where nodes correspond to depots and customer locations. Edges between nodes are established via a Delaunay triangulation augmented by direct depot-to-customer connections, forming a practical, sparse ``star-plus-local'' topology. Each edge $(u,v)$ is annotated with travel time $t_{uv}$, battery consumption $b_{uv}$, and no-fly zone constraints $c_{uv}$.

We generate feasible drone routes via a greedy soft-max heuristic (Algorithm A.~\ref{alg:softmax}, Appendix A.~\ref{app:algorithms}). This algorithm iteratively selects subsequent nodes probabilistically based on incremental travel cost and a temperature parameter $S$ that balances exploration and exploitation. Any generated route violating battery capacity $B_{\max}$ or payload constraints $Q_{\max}$ is immediately discarded, guaranteeing feasibility by construction.

\subsection{Subset-Route Combinational Optimization}

Even after classical preprocessing, directly optimizing thousands of feasible routes remains infeasible. Thus, we recast the drone routing problem as a combinational optimization task: selecting exactly $k=10$ routes from a reduced candidate pool of $N=2048$ feasible routes, assigning each selected route to one of $M=4$ discrete launch waves. The resulting search space contains $\binom{2048}{10} \times 4^{10} \approx 3.6 \times 10^{32}$ possible configurations.

Classical heuristics manage operational constraints by removing overlapping routes within each wave using a greedy duplicate removal strategy (Algorithm~\ref{alg:dropdup}) and assigning routes to drones in ascending travel-time order (Algorithm~\ref{alg:scheduler}). This enables the quantum optimization to focus purely on combinational subset selection without additional constraint complexity.

\subsection{Qubit-Efficient Quantum Representation}

This section presents the 13-qubit encoding that enables quantum optimization on near-term devices. A logarithmic index packs 2,048 routes and four launch waves into just 13 qubits—a 95% reduction from traditional QUBO encodings. Each route-wave pair follows:

\begin{equation}
r = \left(\sum_{j=0}^{n_r-1} 2^{j} z_j\right) \bmod N, \quad 
w = \left(\sum_{j=0}^{n_w-1} 2^{j} z_{n_r+j}\right) \bmod M
\label{eq:encoding}
\end{equation}

Here, $n_r=11$ qubits encode route indices, and $n_w=2$ qubits encode wave assignments. This compressed encoding dramatically outperforms standard QUBO formulations, typically requiring hundreds of qubits for similar scenarios.

\subsection{Cost Oracle and Risk-Aware Optimization}

Robust decision-making under uncertainty requires a cost evaluation scheme sensitive to worst-case outcomes. Our cost oracle combines makespan minimization with penalty terms for operational constraint violations:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
C(\mathcal{S}) &= T_{\max} + \lambda_E \sum_{(u,v)\in E_c} (1-\mathbbm{1}_{uv})^2 + \lambda_V \sum_{v>0}(1-\mathbbm{1}_v)^2 
\quad + \lambda_0 \sum_{v>0}\mathbbm{1}_v^{\text{miss}} + \lambda_W (\text{overbook})^2
\end{split}
\label{eq:cost}
\end{equation}

In this formulation, $\mathbbm{1}_{uv}$ indicates whether an edge $(u,v)$ is traversed, and $\mathbbm{1}_v$ indicates node coverage. Penalty terms strongly discourage constraint violations, ensuring robust solutions.

We minimize the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to handle the inherent stochasticity in quantum sampling:

\begin{equation}
J_{\alpha}(\mathbf{c}) = \frac{1}{\alpha K}\sum_{i=1}^{\alpha K} c_{(i)}
\label{eq:cvar}
\end{equation}

This tail-average focuses the optimizer on worst-case performance, filtering out high-variance samples that could mislead gradient-free search.

\subsection{Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization}

The inherently noisy and non-differentiable quantum optimization landscape necessitates specialized optimization strategies. We employ Optuna's Tree-Parzen Estimator (TPE), which explicitly models performance distributions by fitting separate density estimates for high-performing and low-performing regions. New trial parameters are chosen to maximize expected improvement, efficiently handling heteroscedastic and non-convex cost surfaces. Two TPE configurations---Default and Aggressive---are systematically evaluated, with median-based early stopping criteria to manage computational costs.

\subsection{Classical Benchmarking}

Rigorous evaluation of quantum solutions necessitates benchmarking against well-established classical optimization methods. We adopt a Genetic Algorithm baseline using bit-string encoding, roulette-wheel selection with elitism, adaptive mutation probabilities (high: 0.06, low: 0.012), and two-point crossover. Computational budgets are strictly matched between classical and quantum methods to ensure fair comparisons, with comprehensive tuning results documented in Appendix~\ref{app:algorithms}.

\subsection{Experimental Configuration}

Table~\ref{tab:hyperparams} provides a comprehensive overview of the hyperparameters and configurations used across experiments. Quantum optimization employs a hardware-efficient variational ansatz consisting of $L \in \{1,2\}$ layers, with $N_{\text{shots}}=10000$ circuit evaluations and $N_{\text{mc}}=1000$ Monte Carlo samples for robust cost estimation.

This structured methodological framework systematically reduces quantum optimization complexity while maintaining robust solution quality, demonstrating a viable path toward practical quantum advantage in realistic drone logistics applications.
